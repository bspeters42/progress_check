                <p>Thank you for visiting!  This site shares some of the many things I like to make.  Each page is centered around a major material type: wood, fibers, and paper.  Each page shares some general thoughts and then some details on specific projects. </p>
                
                <h1>Current Projects</h1>
                
                <p>Here is what I am working on right now.  Some projects are completed shortly after they begin, but others are worked on for a while then set aside. These usually tend to be big projects or projects where I am still working my way through fundamentals.</p>

                <h2>Playing Card cross stitch</h2>

                <p>This is an image of the back of a Hoyle Shellback Playing Card in red.  The plan is to translate this image to a piece of counted cross-stitching.  I’ve been working on this for over 10 years.  First, I printed a large version of the image, then began tracing it onto graph paper.  The next step is to rasterize the image as it appears.  From there I work on cleaning up the lines and standardizing the pattern, correcting the variations in design that come from enlarging such a small image to such a large size.  It’s a large project to do by hand and I have to set it aside for a while and work on something else.</p>

                <h2>Knitted Socks</h2>

                <p>A few times a year I get out some knitting needles and knit some socks or a hat or a scarf.  I am currently working on a small series of socks and trying to make adjustments to the pattern to achieve a different fit.  These types of projects require careful attention to a pattern, but the stitches are simple and can be done while watching TV.</p>
